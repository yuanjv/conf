# UNIX-LIKE
(macos is not unix-like btw)

## personal takes

### TIMERS
`systemd timer` sucks. `crontab` is good enough

### PUT ALL SOFTWARES IN CONTAINERS IF YOU CAN

#### flatpak
```
flatpak intall -u XXX
flatpak uninstall -u XXX
```
#### docker
just use root user for docker managments. able to do stuff with docker container means able to do almost anything in the system

#### snapd
fuck this
